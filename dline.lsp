;;;      
;;;   DESCRIPTION
;;;     
;;;     The user is prompted for a series of endpoints.  As they are picked 
;;;     "DLINE"  segments are drawn on the current layer.  Options are 
;;;     available for changing the Width of the DLINE, specifying whether
;;;     or not to Snap to existing lines or arcs, whether or not to 
;;;     Break the lines or arcs when snapping to them, and which of the 
;;;     following to do:  
;;;     
;;;     Set the global variable dl:ecp to the values listed below:
;;;  
;;;     Value  Meaning
;;;     ---------------------------
;;;       0    No end caps
;;;       1    Start end cap only
;;;       2    Ending end cap only
;;;       3    Both end caps
;;;       4    Auto ON -- Cap any end not on a line or arc.
;;;       
;;;     The user may choose to back up as far as the beginning of the command 
;;;     by typing "U" or "Undo", both of which operate as AutoCAD's "UNDO 1" 
;;;     does.
;;;     
;;;     Curved DLINE's are drawn using the AutoCAD ARC command and follow as 
;;;     closely as possible its command structure for the various options.
;;;  
;;;----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;;   OPERATION
;;;
;;;     The routine is executed, after loading, by typing either DL or DLINE
;;;     at which time you are presented with the opening line and menu of
;;;     choices:
;;;     
;;;       Break/Caps/Dragline/Offset/Snap/Undo/Width/<start point>: 
;;;     
;;;     Typing Break allows you to set breaking of lines and arcs found at
;;;     the start and end points of any segment either ON or OFF.
;;;     
;;;       Break Dline's at start and end points?  OFF/<ON>:
;;;     
;;;     Typing Caps allows you to specify how the DLINE will be finished 
;;;     off when exiting the routine, per the values listed above.
;;;     
;;;       Draw which endcaps?  Both/End/None/Start/<Auto>:
;;;       
;;;     The default of Auto caps an end only if you did not snap to an arc
;;;     or line.
;;;     
;;;     Typing Dragline allows you to set the location of the dragline
;;;     relative to the centerline of the two arcs or lines to any value
;;;     between - 1/2 of "tracewid" and + 1/2 of "tracewid".  (There is a
;;;     local variable you may set if you want to experiment with offsets
;;;     outside this range;  the results may not be correct, your choice.
;;;     See the function (dl_sao) for more information.)
;;;     
;;;       Set dragline position to Left/Center/Right/<Offset from center = 0.0>:
;;;     
;;;     Enter any real number or one of the keywords.  The value in the angle
;;;     brackets is the default value and changes as you change the dragline
;;;     position.
;;;     
;;;     Offset allows the first point you enter to be offset from a known
;;;     point.
;;;     
;;;       Offset from:  (enter a point)
;;;       Offset toward:    (enter a point)
;;;       Enter the offset distance:   (enter a distance or real number)
;;;  
;;;     Snap allows you to set the snapping size and turn snapping ON or OFF.
;;;     
;;;       Set snap size or snap On/Off.  Size/OFF/<ON>:
;;;       New snap size (1 - 10):
;;;     
;;;     The upper limit may be reset by changing the value of MAXSNP to a 
;;;     value other than 10.  Higher values may be necessary for ADI display
;;;     drivers, but generally, you should keep this value somewhere in the 
;;;     middle of the allowed range for snapping to work most effectively 
;;;     in an uncluttered drawing, and toward the lower end for a more 
;;;     cluttered drawing.  You may also use object snap to improve your 
;;;     aim.
;;;     
;;;     This feature allows you to very quickly "snap" to another line or arc, 
;;;     breaking it at the juncture and performing all of the intersection 
;;;     cleanups at one time without having to be precisely on the line, i.e., 
;;;     you can be visually one the line and it will work, or you can use 
;;;     object snap to be more precise.
;;;     
;;;     Undo backs you up one segment in the chain of segments you are drawing,
;;;     stopping when there are no more segments to be undone.  All of the 
;;;     necessary points are saved in lists so that the DLINE will close, cap,
;;;     and continue correctly after any number of undo's.
;;;     
;;;     Width prompts you for a new width.
;;;     
;;;       New DLINE width <1.0000>:
;;;       
;;;     You may enter a new width and continue the DLINE in the same direction
;;;     you were drawing before;  if you do this, connecting lines from the
;;;     endpoints of the previous segment are drawn to the start points of 
;;;     the new segment.
;;;     
;;;     If you press RETURN after closing a DLINE or before creating any
;;;     DLINE's, you will see this message:
;;;     
;;;       No continuation point -- please pick a point.  
;;;       Break/Caps/Dragline/Offset/Snap/Undo/Width/<start point>:  
;;;     
;;;     After you pick the first point, you will see this set of options:
;;;     
;;;       Arc/Break/CAps/CLose/Dragline/Snap/Undo/Width/<next point>:
;;;       
;;;     Picking more points will draw straight DLINE segments until either 
;;;     RETURN is pressed or the CLose option is chosen.
;;;     
;;;     CLose will close the lines if you have drawn at least two segments.
;;;     
;;;     Selecting Arc presents you with another set of choices:
;;;     
;;;       Break/CAps/CEnter/CLose/Dragline/Endpoint/Line/Snap/Undo/Width/<second point>:
;;;     
;;;     All of the options here are the same as they are for drawing straight
;;;     DLINE's except CEnter, Endpoint, and Line.
;;;     
;;;     The default option, CEnter, and Endpoint are modeled after the ARC
;;;     command in AutoCAD and exactly mimic its operation including all of
;;;     the subprompts.  Refer to the AutoCAD reference manual for exact usage.
;;;     
;;;     The Line option returns you to drawing straight DLINE segments.
;;;     
;;;     Snapping to existing LINE's an ARC's accomplishes all of the trimming 
;;;     and extending of lines and arcs necessary, including cases where arcs 
;;;     and lines do not intersect.  In these cases a line is drawn from either;
;;;     a point on the arc at the perpendicular point from the center of the 
;;;     arc to the line, to the line, or along the line from the centers of the
;;;     two arcs that do not intersect at the points where this line crosses
;;;     the two arcs.  In this way, we ensure that all DLINE's can be closed
;;;     visually.
;;;     
;;;     Breaking will not work unless Snapping is turned on.
;;;     
;;;----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;;  GLOBALS:
;;;     dl:osd -- dragline alignment offset from center of two lines or arcs.
;;;     dl:snp -- T if snapping to existing lines and arcs.
;;;     dl:brk -- T if breaking existing lines and arcs.
;;;     dl:ecp -- Bitwise setting of caps when exiting.
;;;     v:stpt -- Continuation point.

;;; best-fit to the following criteria:
;;; 
;;;   1) One end of the arc must lie "on" the arc. 
;;;   2) Given that the point given in 1 above is pt1,

;;;      the other arc then use pt2, otherwise the arc does not cross over
;;;      the other arc so use pt1.
;;;      
;;; If the two arcs do not intersect, then a line will be drawn
;;; from the point of intersection of the arc and the perpendicular from
;;; the line of the two arc centerpoints;  The arcs will be 
;;; trimmed or extended as needed to meet these points.
